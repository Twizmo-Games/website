    <p>
        Twizmo! Games offers three unique games, each developed with a similar
        “kit of parts”—a deck of cards and a familiar twist cube. The Original
        Twizmo! is a group-play, three-dimensional twist on Tic Tac Toe. For
        wordsmiths and language lovers Twizmo! Words is a fast-moving
        word-finding game, for almost all ages. For card lovers (and people who
        love them) Twizmo! Cards doubles the fun of poker-style games with two
        “decks” of cards—one on the cube itself!
